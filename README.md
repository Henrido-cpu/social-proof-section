## My process

Step 1: View design preview and think of a plan towards using HTML and CSS for this project. 

Step 2: I decided to go with flexbox on this project and created appropriate containers for elements for more flexible layouting with flexbox.

Step 3: Start building HTML and build it so the site is readable and easy to understand even without CSS.

Step 4: Once HTML built, start building the base layout with flexbox for this project with CSS. 

Step 5: Once base layout done and responsiveness acquired start adjusting fonts and colors. 

Step 6: Once all small details are done start testing for bugs in responsiveness.

Step 7: It works as expected! Project done.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learned and got a lot of practice on the use of flexbox and relative sizing on elements with relative units.



### Continued development

I wish to learn more about aria attributes even though it's not currently in my learning scope, but i can't wait to learn more about them.
